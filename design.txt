Ways seem to basically let the content render, then wrap around the excess content somehow, including:
There seem to be a few basic methods:
A. Recursively with javascript (split at different points until it works): a lot of work and probably slow
B. Let the browser do it, probably thought columns: seems promising, not sure how well it handles long tables and the likes...
C. Render the whole page but show only a section: page borders will cut through images, not usable
Maybe there's a way to use columns to find the break point, then implement those breaks with javascript

It does this client-side using javascript, since users may want to switch back and forth, and since it can't be done
without rendering the page. Also it should be applied to the output page (could be post-process).
Might cause performance issues though, especially on phones etc.

Can this rendering stuff be done off-screen? It has to be technically visible I think, but maybe visibility:hidden or absolutely-positioned outside the screen (top:110vh) or something

First make it without moving figures and tables around, because things become incredibly messy if that's allowed.
Possibly a simple hack would be to move blocks of a minimum hight a few paragraphs down and up, and see if that decreases the total length. Moving can be restricted to the same and next page.
